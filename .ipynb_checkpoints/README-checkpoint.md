# Assignments and Projects

Each course includes hands-on assignments and quizzes designed to reinforce theoretical concepts. Key projects include:

1. **Predicting House Prices (Supervised Learning)**:
  - Implemented linear regression with multiple variables to predict housing prices based on features like size, location, and number of bedrooms.
   
2. **Handwritten Digit Recognition (Neural Networks)**:
  - Built a neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. This involved implementing forward and backpropagation algorithms from scratch.

3. **Movie Recommendation System**:
  - Developed a collaborative filtering system to suggest movies to users based on their preferences and past behavior.

4. **Image Compression using K-means Clustering**:
  - Used K-means clustering to reduce the number of colors in an image, thus compressing it without significant loss in quality.

# Challenges Faced

- **Mathematical Complexity**: Some of the concepts, particularly those related to neural networks and optimization algorithms, required a strong understanding of calculus, linear algebra, and vectorized operations.
  
- **Debugging Algorithms**: Implementing algorithms like backpropagation from scratch without built-in libraries posed a challenge, especially in ensuring numerical stability.

- **Computation Speed**: Some large datasets and computationally expensive models required optimized code and techniques such as mini-batch gradient descent to improve training time.
